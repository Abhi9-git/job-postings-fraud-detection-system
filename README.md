# Fake Job Posting Detection & Comparison Dashboard

This project is a machine learning dashboard designed to detect fraudulent job postings. It combines text-based natural language processing (NLP) with structured metadata columns to train multiple classification models, evaluate their performance, and serve interactive predictions via a beautiful dark-themed web interface.

## ⚡ Prerequisites & Installation

1. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   Ensure you are using the python environment in the workspace.
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Required Dependencies**:
   The requirements are installed in `venv/`, including:
   - `pandas`
   - `numpy`
   - `scikit-learn`
   - `scipy`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `seaborn`
   - `flask`

## Running the Web Dashboard

1. Run the Flask server in development mode:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. Open your web browser and navigate to:

## ⚙️ How the Detection Works
The classifier leverages a combined feature stack:
1. **NLP Text Vectorization**: Consolidates `job_description`, `requirements`, `benefits`, and `company_profile` into a single text block, transforming it using **TF-IDF Vectorization** (extracting top 500 unigrams & bigrams).
2. **Metadata Feature Encoding**: Checks whether the contact email is a Gmail address (`is_gmail`), company logo presence (`has_logo`), number of open positions, telecommuting, experience, and encodes categorical columns (e.g. `industry`, `employment_type`) using LabelEncoders.
3. **Stacked Sparse Matrix**: Combines both metadata and text sparse matrices using `scipy.sparse.hstack` before feeding the classifier.

## 📊 Models Compared
The system supports predictions and side-by-side metric comparisons between:
- **Logistic Regression**: Linear classifier optimized with L2 regularization.
- **Random Forest**: Multi-tree ensemble limiting max depth to avoid overfitting.
- **Decision Tree**: Fast rule-based tree model.
